# Advent of Code

My solutions to Eric Wastl's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles for 2023. Rust was fun last year, so I'm doing it again this year.

Each day is a self-contained Cargo project independent from the others. (I might add some shared libs later.) All solutions expect the input to be piped on stdin.

The `inputs` submodule contains my personal inputs, and is private.
